    <h3>1. Difference between sessionStorage and localStorage?</h3>
    <p>
      = sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while
      data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared
      when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular
      tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to
      that particular tab.

      = The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous
      programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a
      few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
